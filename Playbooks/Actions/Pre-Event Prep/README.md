Pre-Event (PE)
- Cyber Security User Awareness regarding phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and other attacks that involve user interaction
- Set Up Data Collection, data collection is managed by Log Management/Security Monitoring/Threat Detection teams. You need to provide them with a list of data that is critically important for IR process. Most of the time, data like DNS and DHCP logs are not being collected, as their value for detection is relatively low. You can refer to the existing Response Actions (Preparation stage) to develop the list
- Set up a centralized long-term log storage. This is one of the most critical problems companies have nowadays. Even if there is such a system, in most of the cases it stores irrelevant data or has too small retention period
- Develop a communication map for both internal (C-level, managers and technical specialists from the other departments, that could be involved in IR process) and external communications (law enforcement, national CERTs, subject matter experts that you have lack of, etc)
- Make sure there are both online and offline backups. In the case of a successful ransomware worm attack, thats the only thing that will help you to safe your critically important data
- Get network architecture map. It will help you to choose the containment strategy, such as isolating specific network segments
- Get Access Control Matrix. It will help you to identify adversary opportunities, such as laterally movement and so on
- Develop assets knowledge base. It will help you to compare observed activity with a normal activity profile for a specific host, user or network segment
- Make sure your toolset for analysis and management is updated and fully operational. Make sure that all the required permissions have been granted as well
- Access vulnerability management system logs. It will help to identify the vulnerabilities a specific host had at a specific time in the past
- Connect with trusted communities for information exchange
