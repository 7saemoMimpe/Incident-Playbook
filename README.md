### PURPOSE OF PROJECT

That this project will be created by the SOC/Incident Response Community

- Develop a Catalog of Incident Response Playbook for every MITRE Technique (Keep in mind it won't work for some tactics).
- Develop a Catalog of Incident Response Playbook for uncommon incidents.
- Develop a Catalog of Exercise Scenarios that can be used for training purposes.
- Develop a Catalog of tools used for Incident Response `[Plus Reviews for the different tools]`.
- Develop a Catalog of Incident Response Automations. 
- Develop a Catalog of Checklists `[For Before, During, After Incidents]`. 
- Develop a Catalog of Roles that a organization can use, to build their own program.
- Develop a Catalog of Event Codes and API Actions that you can/will see in a SIEM Detections.
- Develop a Card Game based on MITRE Attack and the IR phases that help resolve it.

**For every pull request submitted a issue must also be created.**

- Check the list of [MITRE Techniques](https://github.com/austinsonger/Cyber-Incident-Response-Playbooks/wiki/MITRE-Techniques) to choose from and create a new issue;
- Or you can just look at the list of issues that are ready to be worked on.

## Immediate Goals/Projects
-  Figure out how to Integrate [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/)

## Wiki
- [Creating a Playbook](https://github.com/austinsonger/Incident-Playbook/wiki/Creating-a-New-Playbook)
- [Combining Techniques Into One Playbook](https://github.com/austinsonger/Incident-Playbook/wiki/What-do-if-you-think-combining-techniques-into-one-playbook)
- [Incident Response Phases](https://github.com/austinsonger/Incident-Playbook/wiki/Incident-Response-Phases)

## Notes
- If you think multiple techniques in the Playbook would make sense to add to the higher level tactic playbook, then you can do that.
