### PURPOSE OF PROJECT

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Incident-Playbook/community](https://badges.gitter.im/Incident-Playbook/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/Incident-Playbook/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

That this project will be created by the SOC/Incident Response Community

- Develop a Catalog of Incident Response Playbook for every MITRE Technique (that possible, to make one for).
- Develop a Catalog of Incident Response Playbook for uncommon incidents.
- Develop a Catalog of Exercise Scenarios that can be used for training purposes.
- Develop a Catalog of tools used for Incident Response [Plus Reviews for the different tools]
- Develop a Catalog of Incident Response Automations 
- Develop a Catalog of Checklists (For Before, During, After Incidents) 
- Develop a Catalog of Roles that a organization can use, to build their own program.

- ### [Creating a New Playbook](https://github.com/austinsonger/Cyber-Incident-Response-Playbooks/wiki/Creating-a-New-Playbook)
  - > For every pull request submitted a issue must also be created. 
- ### [MITRE Techniques](https://github.com/austinsonger/Cyber-Incident-Response-Playbooks/wiki/MITRE-Techniques)


---------------------
### Incident Response Phases
This project will use a modified Incident Response Process of mixing SANS Incident Response Process and NIST Incident Response Process. 

> **NOTE:** The common "preparation" phase will not be part of this Incident Response Process, but on each playbook will include a `(P) Preparation` at the beginning of each playbook.

> More than one phase can be running in parallel.

01. Investigate
02. Remediate (contain, eradicate)
03. Communicate
04. Recover
05. Lessons Learned

> If you have any changes that you think would be good for this incident response process please create a issue description what you want to change to this incident response process. 



---------------------

#### Inspiration For This Project
> Just felt like there was something missing for Incident Response and a centrally place for playbooks, SIEM Processes, Forensics and other processes around Incident Response.
