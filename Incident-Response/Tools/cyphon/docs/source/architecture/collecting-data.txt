Cyphon can gather data from a variety of sources, including emails, logs, and external APIs, such as Twitter. In some cases, Cyphon must listen for incoming data, while in other cases, it must actively request new data.


*****
Email
*****

Cyphon collects emails using `Django Mailbox`_. Please see Django Mailbox's documentation for more details.

.. warning::
    Django Mailbox deletes messages from the inboxes it checks. Do not use an email inbox that you would like to share between applications. See `Django Mailbox`_'s documentation for further details.


********
Logstash
********

Cyphon collects log messages through `Logstash`_ and `RabbitMQ`_. `Cyphondock`_ contains Logstash configuration files you can use to get started. See the instructions on `configuring Logstash <http://cyphondock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure-project.html#logstash>`__ for more details.
