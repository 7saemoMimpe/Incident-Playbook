Start Services

.. note::

    If you're deploying with `Cyphondock`_, services will be started automatically. The following instructions are only needed for manual installs.


****************
Backend Services
****************

Ensure the following services are running:

    * `PostgreSQL`_/`PostGIS <http://postgis.net/>`__
    * `RabbitMQ`_
    * `Logstash`_
    * `Elasticsearch`_ and/or `MongoDB`_

Make sure the ``./cyphon/settings/conf.py`` file is configured with the proper credentials for connecting to these services.

Database migrations
-------------------

To setup the PostgreSQL database that Cyphon uses for its Django backend, run migrations from the Cyphon's main directory::

    $ python manage.py migrate


Serving files
-------------

You can serve files using either an Nginx or Apache web server. For details, see Django's documentation for `serving files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/>`__.


************
Celery Tasks
************

Cyphon uses `Celery <http://www.celeryproject.org/>`__ to run periodic tasks, like checking email. These tasks are defined in the ``CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE`` setting of the ``./cyphon/settings/base.py`` file.

To start these tasks, issue the following commands from Cyphon's main directory::

    $ celery -A cyphon beat --detach
    $ celery -A cyphon worker --detach

For more info, see Celery's documentation for `periodic tasks <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html>`__ and `workers <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html>`__.


********
Receiver
********

Cyphon's :ref:`Receiver<receiver>` package is responsible for processing log messages sent to RabbitMQ from Logstash. These messages can be processed by :ref:`Watchdogs<watchdogs-overview>`, :ref:`Monitors<monitors-overview>`, or :ref:`LogChutes<logchutes>`. To create queue consumers for processing log messages, run the ``./cyphon/receiver/receiver.py`` script, specifying the type and number of queue consumers, e.g.::

    $ python ./cyphon/receiver/receiver.py watchdogs 4 &

You can specify "watchdogs", "monitors", or "logchutes" as the consumer type. Ensure that your log messages are being sent to queues using these routing keys. See Cyphondock's `Logstash output plugin <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/blob/master/config-COPYME/logstash/pipeline/3-output.conf#L46-L92>`__ for an example.
