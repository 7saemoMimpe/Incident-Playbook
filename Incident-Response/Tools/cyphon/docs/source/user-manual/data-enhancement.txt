Enhancing Data

Once raw data has been refined, Cyphon can perform analyses on it and label it with the results of those analyses. There are two general kinds of analyses: `Inspections` and `Procedures`. Both are used by :ref:`Labels<labels-overview>` to convey information about a document.

You can configure Inspections and Procedures through the "Enhancing Data" panel on Cyphon's main admin page.

An Inspection tests data against a set of rules, defined by `InspectionSteps`.
Each InspectionStep has a DataSieve to test the data, a result value to return if the data is a match, and a rank that determines the order of the InspectionStep relative to other steps in the Inspection.

.. seealso::
    DataSieves are described in the section on :ref:`Data Processing<sieves-overview>`.

The highest ranking InspectionStep is performed first. If the data is a match, the Inspection ends and that InspectionStep's result value is returned. Otherwise, the next InspectionStep is called. If no InspectionSteps match the data, the Inspection returns a null value.

.. seealso::
    Inspections work in a very similar way to :ref:`Watchdogs<watchdogs-overview>`.

A Procedure is used to perform an analysis that is too complicated to be performed by a DataSieve. A Procedure represents a function in an analytic package that can examine the data and return a result. For example. the function might detect the language of text, or it could determine the geolocation of an IP address.

A Procedure can either examine a particular field in a document, or it can examine the document as a whole.
