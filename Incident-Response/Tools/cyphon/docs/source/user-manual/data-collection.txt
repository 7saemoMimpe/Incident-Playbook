Data Collection
###############

Currently, Cyphon can collect three kinds of data:

   * :ref:`log-collection`
   * :ref:`mail-collection`
   * :ref:`social-media-collection`


.. _log-collection:

************
Log Messages
************

Cyphon ingests log messages using `Logstash`_ and `RabbitMQ`_. You can send logs to Logstash using `Filebeat`_. Once Logstash receives them, you can pass them on to RabbitMQ. From there, messages are processed by Cyphon's Receiver process. If you deploy Cyphon using `Cyphondock`_, this process will be started automatically when you run our Docker Compose files for dev or production environments.

See :ref:`logstash-tutorial` for an example.


.. _mail-collection:

*****
Email
*****

Cyphon uses `Django Mailbox`_ to collect emails. See `Django Mailbox`_'s documentation
if you'd like to learn more about its settings.

.. warning::
    Django Mailbox deletes messages from the inboxes it checks. Do not use an email inbox that you would like to share between applications. See `Django Mailbox`_'s documentation for further details.

Setup Instructions
==================

To configure an email-based data source, click the "Mailboxes" link in the "Manage Mail" panel on Cyphon's main admin page.

See :ref:`email-tutorial` for an example.


.. _social-media-collection:

************
Social Media
************

Cyphon can gather data from social media platforms by searching for specific terms, locations, or people ("followees"). You can configure these filters through the "Filtering Data" panel on Cyphon's main admin page. 

First create search parameters for Followees, Locations, and SearchTerms. You can then create Filters based on these parameters.

See :ref:`twitter-tutorial` for an example.

.. note::

    Currently, Cyphon is only set up to pull data from Twitter. We plan to add support for other platforms (such as Instagram and Youtube) as time permits. If you'd like to help out, please let us know! See our section on :ref:`contributing` for more details.
