Push Notifications
##################


Push notifications let the user know when a new alert has been generated, even when they're not viewing Cyphon. These only work either on your local machine or over SSH. Activating them involves setting up a project on `Firebase`_ and adding certain keys from the project page to the Django configurations.


.. _setup-firebase-project:

**********************
Setup Firebase Project
**********************

The first thing you need to do is setup an account on `Firebase`_ by signing in and following the account setup process. After that, you'll see a button in the top right of the home page that says "Go To Console."

Click this button and you should be brought to a project overview page. On this page you should see a giant button that says "Add Project."

Click this button to name your project and set it up.


.. configure-push-notifications

After setting up the project, you should be brought to the project page. In the top left there is a gear that opens a dropdown.

Click on "Project Settings" in the dropdown menu. You should be brought to the settings overview page that includes your project name and your Web API key.

On this page there will be a tab called "CLOUD MESSAGING." Click on that tab.

All of the information to get push notifications set up is on this page. At first, you won't have a server key. Click the button that says "ADD SERVER KEY" in the top right to create a server key.

Once you have this key, you need to place it in your Cyphon settings ``conf.py`` file. There is a setting called ``NOTIFICATIONS``::

    NOTIFICATIONS = {
        'PUSH_NOTIFICATION_KEY': '',
        'GCM_SENDER_ID': '',
        'IGNORED_ALERT_LEVELS': ['INFO'],
    }

Set ``'PUSH_NOTIFICATION_KEY'`` to your created server key.

After that, go back to the Firebase "CLOUD MESSANGING" tab and look at the "Sender ID" credential. Set ``'GCM_SENDER_ID'`` to this value.

After you've set these two credentials, start up your Cyphon instance. Visit the admin page, and open the "App Configurations" panel. Under "Notifications," click "Config."  You should see a configuration for ``PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED``.

Set this configuration to true and hit save. Push notifications should be
activated now.
