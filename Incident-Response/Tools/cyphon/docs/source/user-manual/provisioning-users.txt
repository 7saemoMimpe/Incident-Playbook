Superuser
*********

If you started Cyphon in development mode using `Cyphondock`_, it should have created a superuser using the ``CYPHON_USERNAME`` and ``CYPHON_PASSWORD`` settings defined in your `.config/env/cyphon.env <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/blob/master/config-COPYME/env/cyphon.env#L1-L2>`__ file.

If you started Cyphon in production mode, youâ€™ll need to create a superuser account manually. You can find instructions under :ref:`create-superuser`.

Once you've logged in as a superuser, can you add additional users.

Adding Users

You can manage users and groups through the "People and Permissions" panel on Cyphon's main admin page.

Cyphon creates users using a slightly modified version of Django's default User model. Unlike the default model, a Cyphon user logs in using an email address rather than a username. Otherwise, they function in much the same way.

.. seealso::
    You can refer to Django's `documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/default/#using-the-django-authentication-system>`_ for more info on users and groups.
