Email Notifications
###################

Cyphon can notify users when an Alert they are working on has been commented on by another user. To enable this behavior, configure the following values under the ``EMAIL`` setting in your ``conf.py`` settings file:

==============  ==============================================================
DEFAULT_FROM    Default email address to use for email notifications.
HOST            The SMTP server used for sending email.
HOST_USER       Username for the SMTP server defined by ``HOST``.
HOST_PASSWORD   Password for the ``HOST_USER``.
PORT            Port for connecting to the SMTP server.
SUBJECT_PREFIX  Subject-line prefix for admin-related email messages.
USE_TLS         Whether to use a TLS (secure) connection with the SMTP server.
==============  ==============================================================

Then open the "App Configurations" panel of the main admin page. Under "Notifications," click "Config."  Confirm that ``EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED`` is set to True.

Users should now receive email notifications when others comment on Alerts that are assigned to them or that they've commented on.
