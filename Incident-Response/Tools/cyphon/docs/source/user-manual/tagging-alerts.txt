Tags can be assigned to Alerts, Comments, or Analyses. Tags can be linked to Articles, which can provide information to help diagnose and remediate Alerts.

Tags are assigned to Alerts by DataTaggers, which examine specific fields and assign Tags based on their content. Tags are assigned to Comments and Analyses automatically when they are saved. 

Administrators can edit or delete Alerts through the "Tagging Alerts" panel on the main admin page.

Topics

Topics are used to categorize Tags. This improves the efficiency of assigning Tags based on the content of Container fields, since a particular field may pertain to only one or a few Topics.

Topics are also used to resolve ambiguity between Tags that have the same name but different meanings. For example, a Tag named "200" could refer to either a port or a status code. This Tag could be associated with either the Topic "Ports" or the Topic "Status Codes" to make its meaning clear.

Each Tag can also be associated with an Article. An Article can contain detailed information relating to the Tag. Articles be linked to multiple Tags, but a Tag can only link to one Article.

DataTaggers

DataTaggers can be configured by specifying a field within a particular Container that should be analyzed for tagging. You can restrict the kinds of Tags that can be used in the analysis by specifying one or more Topics to which the Container field relates.

.. _autotagging:

Autotagging
===========

If the Container field selected for tagging only stores one kind of information (for example, a port number), you can restrict tagging to that single Topic (e.g., "Ports"). This will then give you the option to create new Tags from that field automatically. On the DataTagger admin page, simply select "exact match" and "create tags." This will match the entire content of the Container field against existing Tags belonging to the selected Topic, and it will create a new Tag if a match is not found.
