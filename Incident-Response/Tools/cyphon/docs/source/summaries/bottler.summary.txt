The Bottler package defines custom data models using :ref:`Containers<containers>`. Containers are made up of :ref:`Bottles<bottles>` — which model the data itself — and :ref:`Labels<labels>` — which enhance the data with results of anaylses (such as language detection). :ref:`Tastes<tastes>` provide a way of extracting essential information from a Container (such as title, date, and location).
