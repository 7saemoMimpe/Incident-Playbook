|DataCondensers| allow structured data to be stored in custom formats defined by :ref:`Bottles<bottles>`. A |DataCondenser| is composed of |DataFittings| that map the |BottleFields| in a |Bottle| to |DataParsers|, which are used to process data from :ref:`Pipes<pipes>` or :ref:`DataChutes<datachutes>`.
