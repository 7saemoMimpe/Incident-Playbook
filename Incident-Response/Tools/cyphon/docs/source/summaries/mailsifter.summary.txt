The MailSifter package is responsible for sorting and parsing email messages when they arrive, and sending them to appropriate storage locations. These actions are coordinated by :ref:`MailChutes<mailchutes>`, which use :ref:`MailSieves<mailsieves>` to sort the mail and :ref:`MailMungers<mailmungers>` to parse and store it. MailMungers use :ref:`MailCondensers<mailcondensers>` to transform the email messages using custom data models.
