The LogSifter package is responsible for sorting and parsing log messages when they arrive, and sending them to appropriate storage locations. These actions are coordinated by :ref:`LogChutes<logchutes>`, which use :ref:`LogSieves<logsieves>` to sort the logs and :ref:`LogMungers<logmungers>` to parse and store them. LogMungers use :ref:`LogCondensers<logcondensers>` to transform the logs using custom data models.
