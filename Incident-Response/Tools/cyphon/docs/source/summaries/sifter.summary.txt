The Sifter package is responsible for sorting and parsing data when it arrives, and sending it to an appropriate storage location. These actions are coordinated by :ref:`Chutes<chutes>`, which use :ref:`Sieves<sieves>` to sort the data and :ref:`Mungers<mungers>` to parse and store it. Mungers use :ref:`Condensers<condensers>` to transform the data using custom data models. The Sifter package contains separate subpackages for email, logs, and API data.
