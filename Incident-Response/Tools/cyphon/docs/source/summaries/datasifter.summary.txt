The DataSifter package is responsible for sorting and parsing structured data received from third party REST APIs, and sending it to appropriate storage locations. These actions are coordinated by :ref:`DataChutes<datachutes>`, which use :ref:`DataSieves<datasieves>` to sort the data and :ref:`DataMungers<datamungers>` to parse and store it. DataMungers use :ref:`DataCondensers<datacondensers>` to transform the data using custom data models.
