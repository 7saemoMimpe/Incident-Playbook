The Aggregator package is used to gather data from third parties (particularly social media platforms) using a set of search criteria defined as :ref:`Filters<filters>`. Filters are used to construct queries that are sent to :ref:`Reservoirs<reservoirs>` (such as Twitter) through :ref:`Pipes<pipes>`. :ref:`Plumbers<plumbers>` provide credentials for authenticating the API calls. Records of the calls are saved as :ref:`Invoices<invoices>`. The data returned is processed through :ref:`Funnels<funnels>`.
