The |Ambassador| package provides a general framework for interacting with REST APIs. This framework is used by the more specialized |Aggregator|  and |Responder| packages to send requests to third-party platforms.

The |Aggregator| package sends queries to APIs to find data matching a set of search parameters. Depending on the API, these can be keywords, usernames, locations, and/or timeframes.

The |Responder| package sends a request to an API based on data from an |Alert|. This can be used to check the data against another database or to create a customer support ticket with a third party.

The |Ambassador| package provides base classes to address the general requirements for interacting with a REST API. These classes answer the following questions:

    **Where?**
        Where is the request being sent (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)?

    **What?**
        What endpoint is being accessed (Search API, Streaming API, etc.)?

    **Who?**
        Who is accessing the API? 

    **How?**
        How is the response handled?

    **When?**
        When was the request sent (and what was the response)?
