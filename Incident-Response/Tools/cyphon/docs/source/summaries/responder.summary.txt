The Responder package is used to send REST API requests to third parties based on information from :ref:`Alerts<alerts>`. Requests are defined as an :ref:`Actions<actions>`, which are sent to particular :ref:`Destinations<destinations>` (such as JIRA). :ref:`Couriers<couriers>` are used to provide credentials to authenticate the API requests. Results are saved as :ref:`Dispatches<dispatches>`, which provide information about the API calls and the data returned from them.
