Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams
#####################################

You can view the relationships between Cyphon's Django models using the 
`Graph Models`_ package of `Django Extensions`_. Cyphon is already 
configured to use Graph Models, but you will need to install 
``pygraphviz`` or ``pydot`` to help generate the graphs. 
See the `Graph Models documentation`_ for details.

Use the ``-a`` option to graph all models in the project. Use the ``-o`` 
argument to specify an output file with either a ``.dot`` or ``.png`` 
extension. For example: 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python manage.py graph_models -a -o all_models.png

You can also use the ``-g`` option to group models by app. 

.. warning::

    Grouping models by app imposes constraints on their arrangement that 
    can make relationships harder to interpret. Generate graphs with 
    and without the ``-g`` option to see which you prefer.

To view relationships between specific apps, list them by their app 
labels. For example, the following command would graphs models from  
:mod:`sifter.datasifter.datacondensers.models` and :mod:`bottler.bottles.models`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python manage.py graph_models datacondensers bottles -o datacondensers_bottles.png

This would generate a graph like this:

.. figure:: ../_static/images/graphs/datacondensers-bottles.png
   :alt: Model graph for DataCondensers and Bottles

   Model graph for DataCondensers and Bottles.

To view the same models grouped by application:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python manage.py graph_models pipes datacondensers bottles -g -o condensers_bottles_by_grp.png

This would generate a graph like this:

.. figure:: ../_static/images/graphs/datacondensers-bottles-by-grp.png
   :alt: Model graph for DataCondensers and Bottles

   Model graph for DataCondensers and Bottles, grouped by app.

To find out what models you can graph, refer to the list of 
:const:`INSTALLED_APPS<cyphon.settings.base.INSTALLED_APPS>`.
