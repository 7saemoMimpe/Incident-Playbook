.. _server-faq:

************************************************************
How can I access Cyphon through a domain name or IP address?
************************************************************

To access your Cyphon instance using the external IP address or domain name of your server, add the IP address or domain name to ``'ALLOWED_HOSTS'`` under ``HOST_SETTINGS`` in your ``conf.py`` settings file::

    HOST_SETTINGS = {
        'ALLOWED_HOSTS': [
            'example.com',
            'localhost',
            'cyphon',
        ],
    }

See the section on :ref:`configuring Django <django-config>` for details.


.. _login-faq:

*****************************************
I just installed Cyphon. What's my login?
*****************************************

If you started Cyphon in development mode using `Cyphondock`_, it should have already created a superuser using the ``CYPHON_USERNAME`` and ``CYPHON_PASSWORD`` settings defined in your `.config/env/cyphon.env <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/blob/master/config-COPYME/env/cyphon.env#L1-L2>`__ file. You can use these credentials to login and create other users.

If you started Cyphon in production mode, youâ€™ll need to create a superuser account manually. You can find instructions under :ref:`create-superuser`.


.. _delete-superuser-faq:

**************************************
How do I delete the default superuser?
**************************************

Option 1: Cyphon Admin
======================

Under "People and Permissions" on the main admin page, click "Users", and delete the superuser. If you were logged in as this user, you will be immediately logged out.

Option 2: Command Line
======================

If you're running Cyphondock, you first need to access the shell of the Docker container::

    $ sudo docker exec -it cyphondock_cyphon_1 /bin/sh

This will put you in the main ``cyphon`` project directory where Django's ``manage.py`` file is found. If you're not running Cyphondock, you'll need to switch to this working directory before proceeding.

Access the Django shell::

    $ python manage.py shell

Then delete the user::

    >>> from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    >>> USER_MODEL = get_user_model()
    >>> USER_MODEL.objects.get(email="admin@example.com", is_superuser=True).delete()


.. _logs-faq:

****************************************************
How do I get logs from a remote machine into Cyphon?
****************************************************

We recommend you use `Filebeat`_ and `Logstash`_. Check out our :ref:`Logstash tutorial <logstash-tutorial>` for guidance. If you're using a `Cyphondock`_-based deployment (such as our `Cyphon Virtual Machine <https://www.cyphon.io/cyphon-vm/>`__), see our `Cyphondock documentation <http://cyphondock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure-project.html#logstash-config>`__ for more details.


.. _backup-faq:

****************************************
How do I backup my admin configurations?
****************************************

You can backup your configurations by exporting them as fixtures. See the section on :ref:`dumping-data` for details. Alernatively, you can backup your PostgreSQL database. Consult `PostgreSQL's documentation <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/backup.html>`__ for instructions.
