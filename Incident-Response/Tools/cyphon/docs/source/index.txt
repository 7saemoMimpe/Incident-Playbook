Cyphon is an incident-response platform that receives, processes, and triages events to create a more efficient analytic workflow — aggregating data, bundling and prioritizing alerts, and empowering analysts to investigate and document incidents.

    **Collect**
        Cyphon collects data from a variety of sources, including emails, log messages, and social media. It lets you shape the data however you like, so it’s easier for you to analyze. You can also enhance your data with automated analyses, like geocoding.

    **Alert**
        Cyphon creates alerts for important data as it arrives, so you’re notified when something of interest happens. You can prioritize alerts using custom rulesets, and bundle related alerts so you don't get inundated.

    **Respond**
        Analysts can quickly investigate alerts by exploring related data, and annotate alerts with their findings. With JIRA integration, they can escalate important alerts by creating a ticket in Service Desk.
